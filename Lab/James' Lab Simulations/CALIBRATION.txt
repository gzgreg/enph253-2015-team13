Calibration was done by placing the 5 temperature senesors in a bag  in a water bath and heating the bath to boiling. 
The readings of the five sensors were then averaged and the average was converted to temperature using the equation
given on the the data sheet. This gives the best estimate of the temperature of the water versus time. Each temperature
sensor was then least-squares fit to the temperature curve in order to give invidual equations for converting each
temperature sensor reading to the actual temperature.

results:

Temperature =   0.4737*tmp1 - 1.02   degrees C

Temperature =   0.4525*tmp2 + .8524   degrees C

Temperature =   0.5492*tmp3 + 1.111   degrees C

Temperature =   0.5179*tmp4 + 2.053  degrees C

Temperature =   0.4577*tmp5 - 2.049   degrees C
