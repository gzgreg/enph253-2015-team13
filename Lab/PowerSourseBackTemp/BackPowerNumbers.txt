Using a curve fit a*exp(-b*x)+c for squeeze(readings(3, 2, :)) against squeeze(readings(1, 2, :)):

The c-value is  66.53  (66.41, 66.66): using the fact that the sensor used is about 500*1024 (to an error of about 10%):

T-back = 32.4854 C

T-ambient = mean(squeeze(readings(1, 1, :)))*500/1024 = 22.458 C

Pout = convection+radiation = S*kc*(dT) + S*sigma*1*(T-back^4 - T-ambient^4)
