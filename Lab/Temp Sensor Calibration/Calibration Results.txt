T2 = 1.011*T1 - 1.937: R-Square = 0.9989
T3 = 0.8523*T1 - 3.371: R-Square = 0.9964
T4 = 0.8173*T1 + 0.2576: R-Square = 0.9928
T5 = 1.151*T1 - 5.114: R-Square = 0.9989

(all of these are from curve fitting T1, squeeze(readings(1, 1, :)), against other sensor results)

Using logistic estimation of asymptotes for T2: (custom equation of form b/(1+exp(-k*(x-a))) + c)
T2(20) = 38.5
T2(100) = 183.5

T1 = 1.79*T + 4.14

T2 = 1.81*T + 2.25

T3 = 1.53*T + 0.16

T4 = 1.46*T + 3.64

T5 = 2.06*T - 0.35
